### 💡 The Vision
**DipRadar** is designed to cut through market noise. Instead of blindly buying every dip, it acts as an intelligent funnel: it detects sharp selloffs, automatically filters them through fundamental sector rules, and provides actionable data (Valuation, DCF, Recent News) directly to your Telegram.

### 🚀 At a Glance
- 📉 **Automated Screening**: Tracks Yahoo Finance\'s `day_losers` list.
- 🎯 **Sector Precision**: Uses sector-specific rules (Tech vs. Utilities).
- 📊 **Valuation Layer**: Includes simplified DCF & Margin of Safety.
- 🔔 **Actionable Alerts**: Verdict-based (COMPRAR, MONITORIZAR, EVITAR).
- 📰 **News Context**: Fetches latest headlines for each dip.

### 📊 Sector-Specific Intelligence
We don\\'t force one rule on every business. `sectors.py` applies custom logic to differentiate market sectors.

| Sector | Key Focus |
| :--- | :--- |
| 💻 **Technology** | Growth, FCF Yield, Margins |
| 🏥 **Healthcare** | R&D Pipeline, Patent Cliffs |
| 🏦 **Financials** | P/B, ROE, NIM |
| 🛒 **Consumer** | Brand Moat, Pricing Power |
| 🏗️ **Industrials** | Backlog, Operating Leverage |
| 🏢 **Real Estate** | FFO Yield, Occupancy |
